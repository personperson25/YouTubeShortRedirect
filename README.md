# YouTubeShortRedirect
### Firefox extension to redirect all YouTube shorts to the normal video format.
  
This repository is the source for [this](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-short-redirect/) Firefox addon.
  
Example functionality:  
https://www.youtube.com/shorts/examplevideo  
Is redirected to  
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=examplevideo  
  
This happens both when you click on a short in YouTube and when inputting a shorts URL directly into the address bar.

Shorts pages on YouTube channels are displayed normally, but shorts redirect to the normal format once navigated to.
